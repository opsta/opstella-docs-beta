# Admin

**Role Description**

The Admin role has permissions subordinate to the admin(opstella) role. It has the same capabilities except for deleting platforms; only the admin(opstella) role can perform that action.

**Permission on DevOpsTool**

Because this is the Admin (Platform) role, which is higher than the Service and Component layers, it has the same access to DevOps tools as roles in the Service and Component layers.
